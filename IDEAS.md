# Future Improvements for Crypto Swap

Here are some ideas I've been thinking about for this Crypto Swap interface. These are just thoughts to potentially explore - and I have a few ideas on how I could potentially implement this. I look forward to our discussion towards this.

## UX Enhancements

- **Price History Chart**: Adding a small 24h chart showing price movements would give users more context when making decisions.

- **Time-based Animations**: The interface could subtly pulse or update visual elements when new rates arrive - gives users a sense that data is live.

- **Haptic Feedback**: For mobile, adding subtle vibrations on successful swaps could make the experience more tangible.

- **Dark Mode Support**: Many crypto users prefer dark interfaces especially for night trading (me included).

- **Custom Number Formatting**: Improve number input experience with automatic thousand separators and proper decimal handling.

## User-Centered Features

- **Saved Transaction History**: Keep a local history of swaps to help users track their activity.

- **Favorite Amounts**: Allow users to save common swap amounts for quick access.

- **Price Alerts**: Let users set price alerts for specific BTC values.

- **Fee Estimator**: Show estimates of network/exchange fees for more transparency.

- **Percentage Shortcuts**: Add quick buttons for 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% of available balance.

## Technical Improvements

- **Caching Layer**: Implement a proper caching strategy to minimize API calls.

- **Multiple API Fallbacks**: If one price source fails, automatically try others.

- **WebSocket Connection**: Switch to WebSockets for real-time price updates instead of polling.

- **Cross-Currency Support**: Expand beyond BTC/USD to other crypto pairs.

- **Offline Support**: Add graceful degradation for offline scenarios.

## Business Ideas

- **Referral System**: Give users incentives to invite friends.

- **Educational Content**: Integrate short, helpful crypto knowledge snippets for newcomers.

- **Market Sentiment Indicator**: Add a simple up/down indicator showing overall market trend.

- **Transaction Scheduling**: Allow users to schedule swaps for specific times or price targets.

- **Price Comparison**: Show how our rates compare to other major exchanges.

## Accessibility

- **Screen Reader Optimization**: Ensure all elements have proper ARIA labels and roles.

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Improve keyboard shortcuts for power users.

- **Font Size Controls**: Let users adjust text size without breaking the layout.

- **High Contrast Mode**: Add a high contrast version for users with visual impairments.

## Next Steps

Would be great to prioritize these together and maybe pick 2-3 items for the next sprint. I personally think the price history chart and WebSocket connection would give us the biggest immediate impact.
